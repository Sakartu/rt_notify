# rt_notify
A notification app for OSX for new tickets in Request Tracker

Call the application with --help to see the commandline options and usage.

This application works best if you set "terminal-notifier" in the Notifications Preference pane to display 
"Alerts" instead of "Banners", so that the notifications will remain on-screen.
